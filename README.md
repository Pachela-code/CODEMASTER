# CODEMASTER


Changed framework contents that were used and loaded directly into the folder to make it easier to open the project.

I used Laravel to create the content/backoffice as well as the Blade PHP template for syntax repetition.

Node files are already preloaded in the folder, it is only necessary

Installation of composer (https://getcomposer.org/download/) for the images to link to the project correctly through Laravel.

Just run the commands

 php artisan storage:link
 php artisan serve

inside the project folder.

From then on, all content is fully accessible.
